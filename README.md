# OpenGL-Engine
Fundamental Game Engine

## Main Class: 
OpenGL trial folder, all the classes should be there. The res folder contains some models and their corresponding diffuse maps.

As you can see from the GIF, I can load in multiple models. I created a function where you can change the colour of the light to red green or blue using the keys R,G or B.

There are actually 2 light sources, the animated light is a point light which uses diffuse lighting. And another light which is a replica of the sun which uses directional light and creates a subtle yet strong ambient light.
